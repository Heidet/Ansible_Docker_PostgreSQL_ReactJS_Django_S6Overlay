Sure! Here's the explanation of the playbook tasks formatted in Markdown:

## Ansible Playbook for Web Server Setup

This Ansible playbook automates the installation and configuration of a web server with Docker and Docker Compose, along with the installation of additional packages. The playbook contains the following tasks:

1. **get the username running the deploy**
   - This task runs the `whoami` command to retrieve the username under which the deployment is running and stores it in the variable `username_on_the_host`.

2. **debug: var=username_on_the_host**
   - This task displays the value of the `username_on_the_host` variable in the debug logs.

3. **Install a list of packages**
   - Installs a list of system packages using the APT package manager (for Debian/Ubuntu systems). The installed packages are `ca-certificates`, `curl`, `gnupg`, and `lsb-release`.

4. **One way to avoid apt_key once it is removed from your distro**
   - This task includes the following two sub-tasks to handle Docker installation as the `apt_key` task is removed from the distribution:
     - `install docker gpg key`: Installs the GPG key for the Docker repository from the provided URL.
     - `install docker repo`: Adds the Docker repository to the APT sources.

5. **Install docker**
   - Installs Docker packages using the APT package manager. The installed packages are `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-compose-plugin`, `python3-pip`, and `python3-docker`.

6. **Install PostgreSQL development package (Debian/Ubuntu)**
   - Installs the PostgreSQL development package `libpq-dev` only if the system is Debian or Ubuntu.

7. **Install the docker-compose package**
   - Installs the `docker-compose` package using the APT package manager.

8. **Make sure a docker is running**
   - Checks if the Docker service is started and starts the service if it is not.

9. **Create a directory if it does not exist**
   - Creates a directory `/opt/dockers` if it does not already exist, with the permissions `0640`.

10. **Install rsync**
    - Installs the `rsync` package using the APT package manager.

11. **Synchronization using rsync protocol (push)**
    - This task synchronizes the local directory `./docker-app` with the remote directory `/opt` using the `ansible.posix.synchronize` module. However, this task is currently commented out.

12. **Create and start services**
    - This task uses the `community.docker.docker_compose` module to create and start the services defined in the Docker Compose file located in `/opt/docker-app`.

To run the playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

Replace `inventory` with your inventory file, and `playbook.yml` with the name of your playbook file.
